\page render_pass Render pass

This example demonstrates the use of the render pass system for adding Gaussian noise post-processing effect to a camera.

## Compile and run the example

Clone the source code, create a build directory and use `cmake` and `make` to compile the code:

```{.sh}
git clone https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-rendering
cd gz-rendering/examples/render_pass
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Execute the example:

```{.sh}
./render_pass
```

You'll see:

```{.sh}

## Code

Get the render pass system and create a Gaussian noise render pass. Then we just need to set the noise mean and the standard deviation parameters and apply this render pass to the camera.
