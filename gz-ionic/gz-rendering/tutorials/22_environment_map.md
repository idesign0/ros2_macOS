\page envmap Environment Map

This tutorial shows how to add an environment map to a mesh.

An environment map, also known as a reflection map, is an efficient way to
create reflective surfaces using a precomputed texture. The environment
map texture used by gz rendering needs to be the form of a cube map.

## Example mesh with Environment map

An example of a mesh with an environment map can be found in the `ogre2_demo`,
which uses the ogre2 render engine.

To see the example mesh, build and run the demo:

```{.sh}
cd gz-rendering/examples/ogre2_demo
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Now run it:

```{.sh}
./ogre2_demo
```

There are two meshes in the scene with environment maps. One is the pump and the
other is the gray box on the left. The effect is more evident on the gray box
as it uses a mirror-like material with low roughness and high metalness values.
If you look at the box mesh from different angles, you will notice that there
are reflections of the sky. This mesh is using the same cube map as the one
that is used to create the skybox.

## Code

The code creates a mirror-like material and sets the environment map by giving
it the path to the sky cube map texture.

## Creating a cube map

The cube map accepted by the ogre2 render engine needs to be in a specific
format. You can use the `gimp-dds` plugin to create the texture.

Let's take a look at the sky cube map in gimp. Open `gimp` and import the
[sky_lowres.dds](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-rendering/blob/main/examples/ogre2_demo/media/skybox_lowres.dds?raw=true)
file. Look at the `Layers` windows (`Windows` > `Dockable Dialogs` > `Layers`)
to see that each face of the cube map is in its own individual layer.

To create a new cube map, you will need to have a similar setup to the one
shown above. One way to do this is to modify an existing cube map in
gz rendering and replace the image in each layer with your new cube map
images (there should be 6 of them - one for each face). You can resize the
canvas to match the texture size of you new cube map. Pay attention
to the orientation of the image in each layer as it could be different from
the orientation of other readily available cube maps online since gz
rendering uses Z up instead of Y up.

Once you are done, export the new cube map by going to `File` > `Export As`,
give it a new name, and click `Export`. In the `Save as DDS` dialog, make sure
to select `Save`: `As cube map` and `Mipmaps`: `No mipmaps`. Your newly
exported cube map should be ready to use in gz rendering.
